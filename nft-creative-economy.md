# Building Creative Economies with NFTs

## Understanding NFTs

Charles Hoskinson in quite a few of his videos keeps repeating the same message about what he sees as the success of Cardano in the long term. It is destined to be a financial operating system of the world, it will be something like Kiva on blockchain, it will be the best platform for doing DeFi, it’s an alternative to the traditional banking system for the unbanked population. We get it and we are inspired by it. 

And then there are NFTs. In his video dedicated to NFTs, we see a different version of Charles who seems not having too much to say. NFTs are something he keeps poking around with, but he doesn’t really know what to do with them, maybe just take existing NFT DApps from Ethereum and replant them on Cardano. “Because, why not?”, he says. It seems like the real thing that IOHK was really serious about was the ability to send transactions in any tokens on the blockchain natively without requiring smart contracts and implement the Babel fees and all this cool stuff. But then the idea was like “oh, but if in the minting policy we allow a token to be minted only once, then we get an NFT!”. So it looks like it was more of a byproduct of another IOHK serious brilliancy, than something that had a place in the deliberate strategy that we often see in Charles’ musings about Cardano roadmap.  

But then the NFT craze had happened. Media got overblown with cases of multi-million dollar NFT sales and Cardano’s own Catalyst got about 40 NFT related proposals in Fund 2, and people keep asking and asking for NFTs and NFT marketplaces. At this moment there are more than 20,000 NFTs minted and sold on the Cardano network: SpaceBudz, CardanoBits, some other cool projects, you name it. Everyone is infected with a serious FOMO of not buying something really cool and then reselling it for a lot more than they bought it for. 

Is it just a temporary craze that eventually will go away leaving nothing but ashes after people get over it? Or is there some broader application to NFTs, that can enhance Cardano long-term vision? Basically the question that it comes down to: what do we do with this Cinderella of Cardano and it’s unexpected rise to glory? 

Well, let’s stop for a moment and think what NFT in fact is. NFT can be literally anything that is unique, potentially has a certain value, and has a potential to be monetized. This keyword “potential” is a very potent differentiator of NFTs from smart contracts. Smart contract is deterministic. It is either executed or not. There is no “maybe” in there.  “Maybe you will fix my broken sink and maybe I will pay you”, - this is not a smart contract. 

When Van Gogh was painting his paintings, no one thought they had any value. No one would sign a contract with him, because he didn’t seem like something worth any investment at that time. Yet after centuries passed, Van Gogh’s work is being sold for millions. Do any of his descendants receive any portion of these fortunes? No. It’s been passed around from collector to collector without any royalties. 

How many people inventing or creating something that was too ahead of its time died in complete poverty? And on the other hand, how many people who thought they were geniuses, in fact, created something that currently seems to be mediocre and lies forgotten in the media catalogues and libraries? Or maybe just it’s time hasn't come yet? How do we know and how do we model this uncertainty when people who deserve to be rewarded, or their descendants, do get paid a fair share?

These seem to be the burning questions of so many creative people of the past and the present: “Am I talented?”, “Does my creative work have any value?”, “If it does, then how do I price it properly?”, “If I make it available publicly, how can I protect it so it doesn’t get stolen?”. This constant uncertainty causes so many people abandoning their dreams and going into more predictable office desk jobs, unsure of themselves and pushed by their parents and relatives. This is the true reason why digital artists are so clutching to NFTs. It gives them hope. 

Charles talking about Cardano’s vision being as Kiva on blockchain, will only help people who, figuratively speaking, know how to turn $100 into $10,000. These are entrepreneurs, whose percentage representation even in the most entrepreneurial country in the world, USA, is around 15%. So what are all the other people whose brains are wired differently and who are not that good with money? They are not covered by the Cardano vision and forever will have to be employed at the jobs they don’t want to do? 

You may argue that only a small percentage of people are creative and it could seem to be right. Indeed, the number of people employed in creative jobs in the USA is not as high, only around 5% of the total population. But that’s just jobs and these people already get paid, but what about all these YouTubers, TikTokers, Facebookers, Twitterians and Soundclouders who collectively produce creative content every second and some successfully monetize it. There are millions and millions of them. Some people don’t even know that they are creative, until they draw a picture or sing a song. Nathan Evans didn’t know he was a singer until he sung Wellerman sea shanty on TikTok and has created a wave of followers, who sung along and played various instruments with him, turning it into a tsunami of voices that captivated people like Elon Musk, Jimmy Falon and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Polydor records has signed a deal with Nathan Evans and he was able to quit his job as a mailman. But what about all the other people who helped Nathan rise to fame with their creativity? Did they get a sweet deal too? Don’t think so. 

So how do we predictably capture people’s creativity into an online economy that can be implemented on the Cardano blockchain and complement it’s financial vision and make it not only “the financial operating system of the world” but also “the creative operating system of the world”? 

In order to do this, we need to understand what gives creativity its value. 

## Creativity Value Model

[Marcus O’Dair] (https://www.marcusodair.com/) in his book [Distributed Creativity - How Blockchain Technology will Transform the Creative Economy](https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9783030001896), breaks down the value of creativity into economic and cultural, where cultural is further subdivided into six other values:

- Economic
    - value represented by money
- Cultural
    - Aesthetic
        -  the pleasure we take from listening to a song or looking at a painting
    - Social
        - the connections with others, and the sense of identity and place, that the creative economy helps to cultivate
    - Spiritual
        - the understanding and insight promoted by сultural work
    - Historical
        - a sense of the past, embodied in a work of art , helps illuminate the present
    - Symbolic
        - the meaning conveyed by cultural objects
    - Authentical
        - which derives from the originality and uniqueness of a work

There could be other values, aside from the economic and cultural listed here, for example, contextual, by providing some important context, but for now let’s focus on the ones that are listed. 

We can make an argument that the economic value of an instance of creativity is a function of the other value categories represented in some units. For example social value can be represented by the number of likes and comments on social media, spiritual and symbolic by the quality of cultural notes explaining the meaning behind the artwork. So essentially we have a model of a temporal value chain, where over time the changes in the vector of cultural values will impact the output economic value and where the instance of creativity can be represented by an NFT. 

Just as we said, NFT can be anything. Just an idea passing through your mind that seems interesting, can be captured into some form of digital media, a text, a video, or a sound and be used as an initial seed of some creative process represented by a minted NFT token. It may just stay there, on Cardano blockchain with no attention, or it could be further developed by you, or by others who will be collaborating with you, and will be adding layers of value, like an onion and increasing its economic value potential. 

We don’t have to look far for the concrete examples. All the recent NFT collections minted on Cardano blockchain, transform authentical value of originality and scarcity straight into the economic value of ADA tokens. Nathan Evans’ initial aesthetic value of the Wellerman sea shanty on TikTok, has been complemented over time by added aesthetic value of the other talented singers and musicians, and later by historical value of articles about sea shanties and 19th century seamanship, then by social value of creating a fan base, and even, arguably, a symbolic value when a symbol of our times Elon Musk had twitted about it. 

The creative value chains can be premeditated and contractual, where a group of musicians work together on a song with clearly defined roles and expectations, but could also happen completely organically, like being picked up on social media. 

If we can’t formalize this function to derive the economic value of NFT automatically, at least we can preserve all the metadata that is associated with NFT with complete history and let people make their judgement about it’s economic value by making this metadata available and presented in some easy to understand fashion. 

We already do this every day. When we shop at Amazon, we look at the customer reviews. In this instance, the product that we shop for is the NFT and the customer reviews is it’s metadata. Despite the product being already priced for us, we make our own judgment about it’s true value and if it is worth the listed price. An economic potential of a scientific whitepaper (NFT) can be judged by how many of the peer reviews (metadata) have stated that it has a chance of successful monetization. 

Once NFTs, which currently mostly represented by digital art collectibles, will get over it’s initial craze, and people will start being more careful of what they purchase and how much they spend, availability of such rich metadata collected from the creative value chains, will be crucial for forming an informed opinion about true economic value of the NFT and it’s potential for increase in order to attract investors and collectors. 

NFTs can also be looked at as micro-startups of creative people on the planet. Everyone has creative potential, but only a few of us get lucky to be able to consistently monetize it. Once you have an idea either to record a song, or create a digital drawing, or write a book this is when this micro-startup is formed and in order to bring it to successful monetization, it has to go through certain stages of development that will increase its value in the eyes of a potential customer. This is not unlike business startups, which could be VC-backed and go from seed financing to the successful IPO. 

In this micro-startup analogy we can clearly distinguish between a “value forming system” and “payment distribution system” for NFTs. Value forming system is a value chain that consists of processes that help a creative asset represented by NFTs to be produced and to grow in value. And if someone invested in it or interested in potentially buying it, they need to see progress in real time.  And then, once the economic potential of NFT is reached, it can be monetized and the proceeds have to go to everyone involved, either with a contract that includes royalties to the original creator and key collaborators, and even some little tips to someone who helped promote the NFT product with likes and comments, or by community voting how the proceeds can be fairly distributed if the resulting product has  created organically, like Nathan Evans’ Wellerman. 

## Knowledge Graphs

It may seem like an impossible task to implement such a generic model  on a computer system that will work for a rich variety of use cases, but, in fact, it may not be so unsurmountable. Such unpredictable and versatile value chains can be implemented as knowledge graphs, which are powered by semantic web standards and ontologies. In our daily lives knowledge graphs may be not directly obvious to us, but nevertheless they have been quietly enhancing such ubiquitous  technologies as Google’s search engine and are used practically by all tech giants to better understand what is going on in the web. Although semantic web and ontologies for the past 20 years of their existence went through their own [cycles of hype and disappointment](https://medium.com/@schivmeister/the-semantic-web-where-is-it-now-f4773f3097e3), they recently had [picked up again](https://www.zdnet.com/article/rebooting-ai-deep-learning-meet-knowledge-graphs/). This time in the field of AI, to complement deep learning with ontological inference. 

## Fluree 

One remarkable project in the field of knowledge graphs is [Fluree](https://flur.ee): a Web3 open source semantic graph database combining RDF graph storage with blockchain technologies. It is decentralized and linearly scalable, which makes it a great candidate for making it a sidechain to Cardano, to complement transaction metadata in Cardano with immutable temporal knowledge graphs, stored in Fluree. With Cardano’s close ties and partnership with SingularityNet, such knowledge graphs can provide indefinite possibilities for the AI applications. It may seem all too crazy at the moment, but it might be just a perfect timing for the blockchain, AI and knowledge graphs to come together. At least we have to try! If you are curious what it may lead to, vote for our proposal for the Catalyst Fund 5 Metadata Challenge: [Graph DB Sidechain with Fluree](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Graph-DB-Sidechain-with-Fluree/352531-48088).
