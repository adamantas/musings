# Cardano Catalyst on the Fluree Sidechain

Another great example of a creativity value chain is Cardano’s own Project Catalyst. It fits into this model like a glove. 

Charles in his [Some Musings about the Roadmap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRYRjmMvkJM) video suggests that he’d love to see Catalyst implemented as one of the Cardano’s sidechains. Hopefully we are on the same page as this wise man. 

We'll be using [Fluree](https://flur.ee) as a Cardano's data centric side-chain vision that has been submitted as Catalyst F5 Metadata Challenge proposal. 

## Idea = NFT

Everything on the Project Catalyst starts from an idea. This is an instance of creativity, that we represent by NFT in our creativity value chain model. It has economic value potential measured in required investment and impact on the Cardano ecosystem. Initially we are not sure of this potential and we send this idea into a rigorous process involving multiple people who contribute their creativity into the idea's evolution. This is a creative value chain where everything counts: kudos, comments, community advisor reviews. And that’s metadata, that can be represented by a temporal knowledge graph in Fluree and be preserved in a blockchain forever. 

## Process = Knowledge Graph = Metadata

The metadata will be based on an RDF standard. This metadata will be easily queryable, so we can present it on the UI and aggregate statistics about it and track it’s evolution over time. We will implement automatic assessment of the proposal’s completion. We will implement AI that  will identify similar proposals and suggest candidates for merging.  This AI will also give us some preliminary scoring and will facilitate the work of the community advisors. Once reviews are complete, AI will identify if CA reviews are biased and will escalate this to VCAs. Finally all the reviewed and rated proposals will be presented to the community for voting. 

Once the community votes with their wallets on the Cardano blockchain, the votes and the voting power is recorded in the knowledge graph against each proposal. The winners are automatically funded and non-funded proposals that received a high score get automatic re-enrollment to the next fund, unless the proposers decide otherwise. Treasury distributes all the rewards by crawling the knowledge graph of the winning proposal, applying some algorithm of fair rewards to everyone who participated. Even people giving just kudos will get a little bit of rewards, so they get incentivized to upvote good proposals in the future. 

## Funding Tokenomics

Cardano treasury not just gives ADA equivalent of the requested amount to the funded proposer. The proposer makes an ICO of “somecoins”, mints fungible tokens and the treasury buys a certain set percentage of  these tokens from the proposer, let’s say 1%. It’s up to the proposer what is the volume of the tokens that go to the ICO, but that 1% and the funding amount define the token’s current price. 

Members of the community can also purchase  somecoin tokens, if they are interested in investing in the project. The team members may choose to work for  somecoin as well, which will be traded on mini-exchanges, powered by SPOs. This is essentially the same model as partial ownership of NFTs. 

Once the funded solution starts operating it can demand transaction fees to be paid in somecoin and be covered by Babel fees. This will be driving the price of the somecoin up and for the successful project, the 1% of treasury investment will grow and allow for funding even more projects in the ecosystem. 

## Tracking Progress

Every update from the dev team on the progress of the project should be captured in the knowledge graph. Doing time travel and seeing how the project was progressing, will give an indispensable tool for new teams to learn from mistakes of others and adopt the techniques that worked. The ability to store all the project's data in the knowledge graph, and see it in real time, will make people excited to follow the status of the project and purchase more somecoins if they see that it’s going well. 

If anyone sees ideas shared here that are interesting, don’t hesitate to reach out and talk about it. This also will be posted on Reddit and Twitter. 

See you in the townhall chat fellow cardanians! And all the best!
